Focus:

Suicide rates. Male / Females. Rural / urban / metropolitan. Population density?


What is the focus?
We're interested in the suicide rates of different groups, such as gender, area, race, time, etc. 
Our primary scope will be focused on USA, since USA has the richest amount of data available.

Why is it interesting?
Suicide is supposedly the 10th leading cause of death in 2017. There are large differences between the categories defined above.
Informing suicide prevention organisations and other interested parts about these trends, 
should be able to generate some clarity about the importance of the matter, and what we can do to prevent in the future.

What outcome do you expect from your research
The suicide rate among isolated individuals will be higher. Cases of prolonged mass isolation are limited. We can't use Covid-19 data because of lack of data. 
Gathering information about other cases might provide insight, about how the possible trends in suicide rates in America fluxes with isolation. 

Who may be the user of the results?
The results are primarily targeted towards interested organisations, herein suicide prevention organisations. 
The statistics will be publically available.



Stage 1: Business Case Foundation
1. Collect ideas and define a business or social domain, where data science can bring a value.

Suicide rates. Male / Female. Rural





2. Search Internet and get inspired by sources of information, related to your ideas.
3. Formulate context, purpose, questions, and hypotheses for a data science experiment.
4. Technology
a. Select and install software tools and development environments.
b. Create a Github repository, which will host all project components during all stages of the
development and implementation process.
c. Create and upload a .md file as an initial release of the project, which contains brief
annotation of your ideas, in minimum four sentences, telling:
• what is in the focus of your interest?
• why is it interesting?
• which outcome do you expect from your research?
• who may be a user of the results?
